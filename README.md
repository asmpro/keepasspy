keepasspy
=========

CLI operations (read-only) on KDB4 (.kdbx, KeePass 2.x) database files.
Program is using libkeepass to access kdbx files.
CLI shell version is under development.


Future development plans:
-------------------------
- Further improve libkeepass, which is for example missing full support for KDB3 (.kdb, KeePass 1.x)
  database files.
- Extend read-only command line options of CLI version
- Support for write operations of CLI version
- GUI support using wxWidgets or maybe some other GUI toolkit
